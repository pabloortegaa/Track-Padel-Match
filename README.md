# Track-Padel-Match
The purpose of this project is to create an app that can create some real-time statistics in padel matches.
This project has been started in June 2022, and during this year I will upload the new improvements that I will be doing in my free time.
From now, we have the Minimap, where we can see the position of each player, and we could create a heatmap  in the future. 

Upcoming improvements:

- Ball tracking. For this, I have two ideas. The first is to use Tracknet, a CNN that is normally used to track the ball in tennis matches. The other option is to use a transformer, which will give better performance but will be more difficult to train and develop.

- Improve human detection. Now we are using Yolov5, but we could create our own person/player detection or use a better model.

Of course there are more things to do, but these are the most important in the short term.
